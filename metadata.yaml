description: Harold Travilla marries Gracie Raymond on New Year's Day, and the happy
  couple honeymoons at Viamede, Grandmother Elsie's Louisiana plantation. The rest
  of the family travels on the Dolphin to join them, and along the way Grandmother
  Elsie and Captain Raymond regale the children with tales from Southern history,
  and Cousin Ronald entertains them with stories of his native Scotland. The happy
  family grows yet again when Lucilla and Chester welcome a healthy baby boy to the
  clan. The Dinsmores and Raymonds then make plans to spend the summer at Crag Cottage,
  Evelyn's beloved home.
